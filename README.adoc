**React for XP: handling and rendering of pre-built React components in Enonic XP**

This library runs on link:https://enonic.com/developer-tour[Enonic XP] server side, and provides:

  - services that serve (autodetected and) pre-compiled React components and their dependency scripts to the browser, from a specific file structure. These services also provide headers for caching components and dependencies in the browser.
  - library of XP controller functions, that make it easy to blend React into XP components, in a variety of ways
  - server-side rendering option in XP, through the controller functions  
  - client-side wrapper tailored for use with the services - itself available to the browser through one of the services.

[[versions-and-compatibility]]
== Versions and compatibility
This is version **1.6.0-RC1** for XP 7.

This library, lib-react4xp, is installed as a regular XP library in a parent app/project. It also needs to run alongside a suite of *NPM packages*. These are bundled (by dependency) in the link:https://www.npmjs.com/package/react4xp[react4xp package], so by installing that one, you get the necessary packages. 

*This package is needed both in this library and in the parent project* that uses the library - and preferrably with _matching package version_ in both places. The library versions correspond with particular package versions. Whenever a library upgrade requires a new package version, whis table will be updated: 

[%header,cols=2]
|===
| **lib-react4xp** | react4xp package (in both lib and app) 

| 1.0.1 | 1.0.0 
| 1.1.0 | 1.1.3 
| 1.1.1 | 1.1.4 
| 1.4.0 | 1.4.0 
| 1.5.0 | 1.5.4 
| **1.6.0-RC1** | 1.5.7 |

[[setup-with-react4xp-starter]]
== Setup, option 1: The React4xp starter

If you're starting with a fresh React4xp project and Enonic XP 7.x, by far the easiest way is to follow link:https://developer.enonic.com/templates/react4xp[the instructions in the React4xp tutorial], and build it from there. The starter always uses the latest stable version of this library.

The React4xp starter is also link:https://market.enonic.com/vendors/enonic/react4xp-starter[available at enonic market] or as link:https://github.com/enonic/starter-react4xp[open source at github].

[[setup-in-existing-project]]
== Setup, option 2: Using React4xp in an existing project

If you want to skip the starter and inject React4xp in your own XP 7 project, you can. Follow these steps to get all the moving parts up and running:



[[prerequisites]]
=== 0: Prerequisites
Assuming you have Enonic XP 7.x nicely installed, and you have an **XP parent project** app set up for it (a project where you want to use React4xp).



[[add-lib-react4xp]]
=== 1: Add lib-react4xp

Two ways to add this library to a parent project: import it from an online repository, or build it from scratch:


[[import-from-lib]]
==== 1.1: Import it from a repository...
Insert into `build.gradle` in the parent project, under `dependencies`:
[source,groovy,options="nowrap"]
----
dependencies {
	include 'com.enonic.lib:lib-react4xp:1.6.0-RC1'
}

repositories {
    maven {
        url 'http://repo.enonic.com/public'
    }
}
----


[[fork-and-build]]
==== 1.2: ...OR fork and build it yourself
If you need / want to build the lib yourself instead of downloading it with Gradle, add these steps: 

**1.2.1.** Clone or otherwise download link:https://github.com/enonic/lib-react4xp.git[the source code for this lib] into _its own root folder_ (not into XP_INSTALL or the parent project folder).

**1.2.2.** Make the version unique in the library's `gradle.properties`, for example:

[source,properties,options="nowrap"]
----
version = 1.6.0-RC1-SNAPSHOT
----

**1.2.3.** Build it with gradle:

[source,commandline,options="nowrap"]
----
gradlew publishToMavenLocal
----

Gradle will build the library and install it into the local cache, available for other projects.


**1.2.4.** Finally, go to the parent project folder root.  Make sure that the version you downloaded/built matches your local reference in `build.gradle`, under `dependencies`, e.g.:

[source,groovy,options="nowrap"]
----
dependencies {
    include 'com.enonic.lib:lib-react4xp:1.6.0-RC1-SNAPSHOT'
}
----

Other handy gradle dev tasks are `clean` and `build`.

---



[[npm-install]]
=== 2: Install NPM packages
Go to the _parent XP project folder_ and use the command line to add these NPM packages as _devDependencies_:

[source,commandline,options="nowrap"]
----
npm install --save-dev react4xp@1.5.7
----

Again, if you're using a different version of this library than 1.6.0-RC1, the NPM package may need a different, matching version than `react4xp@1.5.7`. See link:#versions-and-compatibility[above].

Other development tools might be needed, depending on your setup:

[source,commandline,options="nowrap"]
----
npm add --save-dev @babel/cli@7 @babel/core@7 @babel/preset-env@7 @babel/preset-react@7 @babel/register@7 webpack@4 webpack-cli@3
----

Etc.



[[react4xp-properties]]
=== 3: Configuration: react4xp.properties

A few configuration properties are needed to guide the build steps.

When you've installed the NPM package **react4xp@1.4.0** or higher, you'll find the general config file link:https://github.com/enonic/react4xp-npm/blob/master/packages/react4xp/src/react4xp.properties[react4xp.properties] at _node_modules/react4xp/react4xp.properties_. It has usage instructions and explanations in it for configuring your react4xp project by changing values and commenting in/out the different settings to your liking.

**Copy it to your project folder** at the root! Now it's activated, and it will be used by _node_modules/react4xp/react4xp.gradle_ (again, depends on react4xp@1.4.0 or higher) to build your project. If you use your own build.gradle setup instead, just look there for reference.




[[gradle-build]]
=== 4: Gradle build setup
As of version 1.1.0 of link:https://www.npmjs.com/package/react4xp[the react4xp NPM package], the react4xp gradle build setup is shared in `react4xp.gradle` in the `react4xp` package. 

As long as that's installed and `npm i` (or similar) has been run before the gradle build, you can simply add this to your `build.gradle`: 

[source,groovy,options="nowrap"]
----
apply from: "node_modules/react4xp/react4xp.gradle"
----

If that for some reason is not an option for you, or you want a modified version of the setup, you can link:https://github.com/enonic/react4xp-npm/blob/master/packages/react4xp/src/react4xp.gradle[find react4xp.gradle here] and build that into your project.



[[transpile-components]]
=== 5: Gradle: XP component transpilation (optional)

If you want, or already have, Babel (etc) transpilation for your XP controllers and other assets, this needs to be done separately from the build tasks above! **Make sure that the XP compilation step does not compile your react component source files!** 

Here's an example from the starter; a gradle compile task that **leaves `.jsx` files alone**:

[source,groovy,options="nowrap"]
----
task compileXP(type: NodeTask) {
    description 'Compile regular (non-React4xp) XP components from ES6, ignoring JSX components'

    script = file('node_modules/@babel/cli/bin/babel.js')
    args = ["src/main/resources", "--out-dir", "build/resources/main", "--ignore", "**/*.jsx"]      // <-- Ignoring JSX in the XP structure

    inputs.dir 'src/main/resources'
    outputs.dir("build/resources/main")
}
compileXP.dependsOn += 'config_tasks'
jar.dependsOn += 'compileXP'
----

(Why is this needed? For simple development after everything's set up, React4xp detects and autocompiles `.jsx` files inside `src/main/resources/site`. This is to encourage a regular-XP-like structure, simply using `.jsx` files as part/page/layout _views_: just keep React entry components in the same folders, with the same names, as the corresponding XP components that use them (this structure is not _enforced_, though - using `entryDirs` and `chunkDirs` in `react4xp.properties` (see below), your react source files can basically be anywhere). However, _the react files are handled differently from other XP components and assets, both at build- and runtime!_ For that reason they must be separated, in this example by using different file extensions: `.jsx` and `.es6`, respectively)






[[build-and-run]]
=== 6: Build and run it all
Voilà, such easy (I hope)! From the parent project, this can now be run as a regular XP app:
[source,commandline,options="nowrap"]
----
enonic project deploy
----

Or, setting the environment variable `XP_HOME` (e.g. `export XP_HOME=~/.enonic/sandboxes/myProjectSandbox/home`), you can use regular gradle tasks such as `clean`, `build`, `deploy`.

[[development]]
== Development

Getting started with working on this library locally.


[[local-build]]
=== Local build

Run this first to get set up.

[source,commandline,options="nowrap"]
----
gradlew build
----


[[npm-linked-mode]]
=== NPM-linked mode

This lib (and consuming react4xp apps) requires the corresponding link:https://www.npmjs.com/package/react4xp[react4xp NPM packages]. If you want to work with this lib with _local versions_ of those packages too, it's convenient to symlink them up under `node_modules`: 

1. Download/fork/clone link:https://github.com/enonic/react4xp-npm[react4xp-npm] from github to a separate source folder,

2. From that root react4xp-npm folder:
+
[source,commandline,options="nowrap"]
----
    gradlew npmLink
----
 
3. Back in the root folder of _this lib_, run react4xp-npm's `getLinks` script (sorry, this script has no windows version yet, but should be fairly easy to reverse-engineer): 
+
[source,commandline,options="nowrap"]
----
    sh relative/path/to/local/react4xp-npm/getlinks.sh
----
4. Install the lib locally (see the next heading below),

5. From the root folder of your react4xp app project too, run `getLinks` with a relative path (same way as in step 3 above),

6. Build the react4xp app.


[[install-lib]]
=== Install the lib

To install the built library in local maven cache, available for building react4xp app(s) locally, follow link:#fork-and-build[the instructions above].


[[lib-usage]]
== Usage

Basic library import in XP controllers:

----
const React4xp = require('/lib/enonic/react4xp'); 
----

Beyond this, using react4xp is beste explained in the link:https://developer.enonic.com/templates/react4xp[React4xp introduction guide].
