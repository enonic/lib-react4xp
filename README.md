# lib-react4xp-runtime

**React for XP: handling and rendering of pre-built React components in Enonic XP**

This library runs on [Enonic XP](https://enonic.com/developer-tour) server side, and provides:
  - services that serve pre-compiled React components and their dependency scripts to the browser, from a specific file structure. The package [react4xp-build-components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react4xp-build-components) builds this structure from React source files. These services also provide headers for caching components and dependencies in the browser.
  - library of XP controller functions, that make it easy to blend React into XP components, in a variety of ways
  - server-side rendering option in XP, through the controller functions  
  - client-side wrapper tailored for use with the services - itself available to the browser through one of the services.

## Install

_This library is a work in progress at the moment_. The install process will be simplified before long, in particular publishing this lib on [Enonic Market](https://market.enonic.com/), and using a Gradle plugin to import it into your XP project. 

If you still want to try it out right now, here's how:

#### 1: Prerequisites
Assuming you have Enonic XP nicely installed, and you have an **XP parent project** app set up for it (a project where you want to use React4xp). Look for a React4xp starter in Enonic Market.
  
#### 2: Download
Clone or otherwise download [the source code for this lib](https://github.com/enonic/lib-react4xp-runtime.git) into _its own root folder_ (not into XP_INSTALL or the parent project folder). 
  
#### 3: Install this lib locally
From that folder, run:
```bash
gradlew build install
```
Gradle will build the library and install it into the local cache, available for other projects.

#### 4: NPM: import packages in the parent project 
Now go to the _parent XP project folder_. Either add these packages to `package.json` as `devDependencies`, or install them from your command line (`npm add --save-dev ...`):
```json
devDependencies: {
	"react4xp-buildconstants": "0.6.0",
	"react4xp-build-components": "0.2.0",
	"react4xp-runtime-externals": "0.1.0",
  }
```
The last one of these are optional. Depends on whether you use it in `build.gradle` in step 6 below - it is used in these instructions.

Two other NPM packages are mentioned/commented out in step 6, but already included in this library. You only need to install those here if you need to use other or customized versions:
  - `react4xp-runtime-client` (included version: 0.2.5)
  - `react4xp-runtime-nashornpolyfills` (included version: 0.1.1)

Remember to add any peer dependencies you might be missing in the parent project.

###### All package docs:
  - [react4xp-buildconstants](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react4xp-buildconstants)
  - [react4xp-build-components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react4xp-build-components)
  - [react4xp-runtime-externals](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react4xp-runtime-externals)
  - [react4xp-runtime-client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react4xp-runtime-client)
  - [react4xp-runtime-nashornpolyfills](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react4xp-runtime-nashornpolyfills)

 
#### 5: Gradle: import the installed lib in the parent project 
Insert into `build.gradle` in the parent project, under `dependencies`:
```groovy
dependencies {
    include 'com.enonic.lib:lib_react4xp_runtime:0.1.0-SNAPSHOT'
}
```
The `0.1.0-SNAPSHOT` part is of course the version of this library, and must match the actual version that you built and installed in step 2 and 3.

#### 6: Gradle: set up the build steps using the lib
Your parent project needs two important gradle tasks: 
  - `config_react4xp` sets up a master config file, defining the project structure and React4xp's place in it. This config file is heavily used in both build- and runtime.
  - `webpack_react4xp` builds your parent project's React components and other necessary parts, into pieces that will be run by this library.
  
Add this section or similar to the parent project's `build.gradle`:
  
```groovy
import groovy.json.JsonSlurper

// Config file name for buildtime. Note that the runtime needs a copy of it in the folder of the react4xp lib - a location predicted by the constants defined in the config file itself. This is magically handled by the react4xp-buildconstants script package:
def REACT4XP_CONFIG_FILE = "build/react4xp_constants.json"

// Resolves the project folder root
def ROOT = new File("").absolutePath

// Necessary placeholder, will be filled during build
def CONFIG = {}

// Override config values to taste with a JSON-parseable string. See the react4xp-buildconstants docs:
def REACT4XP_OVERRIDES = '{"outputFileName": "' + ROOT + '/' + REACT4XP_CONFIG_FILE + '"}'

// Build the master config JSON file and the copy:
task config_react4xp(type: NodeTask) {
    script = file('node_modules/react4xp-buildconstants/cli.js')
    args = [ ROOT, REACT4XP_OVERRIDES ]

    // After the above script has run and created the config file, use the constructed values from the script to update the configuration of the next task(s):
    doLast {
        // Read the file content into an object
        def configFile = new File(REACT4XP_CONFIG_FILE)
        CONFIG = new JsonSlurper().parseText(configFile.text)

        tasks['webpack_react4xp'].configure {
            inputs.dir(CONFIG.SRC_SITE)        
            inputs.dir(CONFIG.SRC_R4X)
            outputs.dir(CONFIG.BUILD_R4X)
        }
    }
}
config_react4xp.dependsOn += 'npmInstall'


// Compile:
task webpack_react4xp(type: NodeTask) {
    script = file('node_modules/webpack/bin/webpack.js')
    args = [
        // 1 MANDATORY STEP:
        '--config', 'node_modules/react4xp-build-components/webpack.config.js',			// <-- This step compiles the components added in this project into runnable/renderable components. See react4xp-build-components docs.
        
        // 3 OPTIONAL STEPS:
        //'--config', 'node_modules/react4xp-runtime-client/webpack.config.js',   		// <-- Activate this line to override the included clientside wrapper (included in lib-react4xp-runtime) - see the react4xp-runtime-client docs.
        //'--config', 'node_modules/react4xp-runtime-nashornpolyfills/webpack.config.js',  	// <-- Activate this line to roll your own nashorn polyfill instead of the included one. See react4xp-runtime-nashornpolyfills docs.       
        '--config', 'node_modules/react4xp-runtime-externals/webpack.config.js',  		// <-- This line supplies dependencies declared in the EXTERNALS config constant - see the react4xp-runtime-externals docs. If you remove this line, you can/must add react@16 and react-dom@16 on all your HTML pages yourself - e.g. from a CDN.

        '--env.REACT4XP_CONFIG_FILE=' + ROOT + '/' + REACT4XP_CONFIG_FILE, 			// <-- Tells all of the steps here where to find the master config file
        '--progress', '--color'  								// <-- Just pretty
    ]

    inputs.file(REACT4XP_CONFIG_FILE)
    inputs.file("package.json")
    inputs.file("package-lock.json")
}
webpack_react4xp.dependsOn += 'config_react4xp'

jar.dependsOn += 'webpack_react4xp'
```

#### 7: XP component transpilation (optional)

If you want Babel (etc) transpilation for your XP controllers, **this needs to be done separately from the build tasks in step 5!** 

(Why? For simple development after everything's set up, React4xp encourages you to keep React entry components in the same folders as the corresponding XP components that uses them. But both build- and runtime handles React and XP components very differently. For that reason **they must have different file extensions**: .JSX and .ES6, respectively. Typescript support should be fairly easy to add)

This can be done in the regular XP way, but here's an example gradle task that both aligns xp transpilation with eventual tweaks in the config file, as well as makes sure not to mix up XP and React components:   

```groovy
task babelXP(type: NodeTask) {
    script = file('node_modules/babel-cli/bin/babel.js')
    args = ["src/main/resources", "--out-dir", "build/resources/main", "--ignore", "**/*.jsx"]      // <-- Ignoring JSX in the XP structure is important!

    inputs.dir 'src/main/resources'
    outputs.dir("build/resources/main")
}
babelXP.dependsOn += 'config_react4xp'
babelXP.dependsOn += 'processResources'

jar.dependsOn += 'babelXP'
```

...and add this at the end of the `doLast` block in the `config_react4xp` gradle task:
```groovy
        tasks['babelXP'].configure {
            args = ["src/main/resources", "--out-dir", CONFIG.BUILD_MAIN, "--ignore", "**/*.jsx"]  // <-- Still ignoring JSX in the XP structure
            outputs.dir(CONFIG.BUILD_MAIN)
        }
```

#### 8: Build and run it all
And voilÃ ! Such easy! From the parent project, this can now be run as a regular XP app:
```bash
$ cd <project folder>
$ gradlew deploy
$ cd <XP server folder>
$ bin/server
```

    

## Usage
### Overview

There are 3 main ways to use this library with XP:

1. React components **directly inside XP components in Content Studio** (parts and pages for now, although layouts _might_ work). That is, the React component is part of an XP component's view, and handled and referred in the XP component's controller. This approach is made to be easy to use, and lets the controller fetch data in regular XP ways (portalLib's `.getComponent`, `.getContent` etc), and also has methods for server-side rendering and client-side hydration - as well as automatically adding headers for effective client-side caching of the resources. This mode can also automate the HTML side of things if you want - handling the React insertion container by itself, even without a specific HTML view file for the part/page if necessary.

2. React components in web pages that are rendered by XP controllers, but **outside the XP Content Studio flow** - for example when getting a page from an XP webapp or a service. This approach also has access to XP's serverside logic and the React4xp helper methods of this library, but makes a manual reference to the React component (this can also be done in the first component-oriented approach, if needed).

3. **Standalone client-side mode**. In this case, an HTML file loads the react4xp client script from the `/react4xp-client` service. This exposes methods that a browser can call. It can either manually trigger rendering of already-loaded components, or use a method that automates it: just list the React4xp component names, their target container IDs and their props, and let the client call the services in _this_ lib to first find URLs for the dependency resources needed, download and run them, and finally trigger their rendering. This requires this library to provide the services, but otherwise uses the [react4xp-runtime-client package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react4xp-runtime-client)  (**included in this library, no need for a separate installation**) - look there for docs and examples on the standalone mode.




### Examples: Hello World

#### 1. Content Studio-ready Component

Similar-looking to how things are otherwise handled in Enonic XP components, add a JSX react file to the same folder as an XP part or page. File names matter - use the same name as the part or page, and a `.jsx` file extension.

```jsx harmony
// site/parts/example/example.jsx:

import React from 'react';

export default (props) => <p>Hello {props.greetee}!</p>;
```

Import the `React4xp` library in the part controller, and let it use the `request` and the part's `component` data - here wrapped in a `params` object along with the React `props`.  

```jsx harmony
// site/parts/example/example.es6:

const portal = require('/lib/xp/portal');
const React4xp = require('/lib/enonic/react4xp');

exports.get = function(request) {
    const params = {
        component: portal.getComponent(),
        props: { greetee: "world"}
    };
    
    return React4xp.render(request, params);
};
```

`React4xp.render` returns a response object ready to be returned directly from the controller: just like in a regular XP controller, it will contain some HTML under `body` (component server-side rendered with the initial props into a container). It will also have some `pageContributions` that makes the browser contact the server and download and run the compiled scripts for the component itself, and its dependencies (notably for hydrating the component on the client side).

That's it. Add the part to a page in XP content studio, and rejoice as the world is greeted!


#### 2. From an XP controller outside of Content Studio

Just like in a vanilla React setup, you could just make a regular HTML document that refers by URL to the component and its dependencies, and let XP serve these as simple static assets, as long as they've been compiled previously.

However, React4xp aims to make this easier in use, and deliver some performance gain while we're at it. 

##### JsxPath
_The one important concept to note here is **the jsxPath**, which is React4xp's internal name for each React entry component_. This name is derived at build time from the path of the transpiled react component, relative to a particular target folder in the JAR artifact of your app - but make no mistake, `jsxPath` is a _name string_, not a path that can be used relatively! This is described better below, but in short: 

- If a JSX source file is inside an XP component folder, the jsxPath will be _the XP-relative path to the source file, without the file extension_ - the same way as you would import it elsewhere in XP. When you have the jsxPath, you can use the component from anywhere in React4xp - including a standalone HTML file. 
    - For example, `example.jsx` from the first example, is in `<projectFolder>/src/main/resources/site/parts/example/example.jsx` and will get the jsxPath `site/parts/example/example`. 
- If a JSX file is independent from XP components too, it should be put below a special source folder in order to work: `<projectFolder>/src/main/react4xp/_components`. The jsxPath will then be the path-and-name of the source file relative to that folder (still without file extension) (the path to this magic folder can be adjusted with the React4xp config file)
    - So `SimpleGreeter` in the example below is the jsxPath of an independent React component built from `<projectFolder>/src/main/react4xp/_components/SimpleGreeter.jsx` (but we could just as well have used the `site/parts/example/example` jsxPath). 
    
And so on.
 
##### Okay, get to the example already:
The `react4xp` service at the URL `<domain>/_/service/<xp.parent.app.name>/react4xp` serves runnable assets to the browser - both the component itself and its dependencies. So the runnable code for e.g. the `SimpleGreeter` component is available at: `<domain>/_/service/<xp.parent.app.name>/react4xp/SimpleGreeter`. We can also use a single controller function from this library, `dependencies.getAllUrls(jsxPath)`, to check if the component has any dependencies, and get an array of service urls for those, if there are any (`.getAllUrls` also accepts an array of jsxPaths, which will automatically prevent duplicate downloads of shared dependencies).

That's all the client needs. In this case, we use thymeleaf to insert the URLs into an HTML document from a standalone XP controller: 

```jsx harmony
// The controller, main.es6:

const thymeleaf = require('/lib/xp/thymeleaf');
const view = resolve('main.html');

const dependencies = require('/lib/enonic/react4xp/dependencies');

exports.get = req => {

	const urls = dependencies.getAllUrls('SimpleGreeter');
	const componentUrl = `/_/service/${app.name}/react4xp/SimpleGreeter`;
	
	// Note that the order matters! The component must be loaded AFTER its dependencies, so we add it last in the url array. 
	urls.push(componentUrl);
	
	const model = { urls };
	return {
		body: thymeleaf.render(view, model)    
	}
};
```

What happens when the browser runs the component and dependency scripts? One of the dependency urls we got from `getAllUrls` from will be the React4xp client wrapper (at `/_/service/<app.name>/react4xp-client`). When this is run, the wrapper is exposed to the browser as `CLIENT` in a global object `React4xp`. 

The component script is also downloaded and run, and adds the React component `SimpleGreeter` to the same `React4xp` object: 

```jsx harmony
// src/main/react4xp/_components/SimpleGreeter.jsx:

import React from 'react';

export default (props) => <p>Hello {props.worldOrWhatever}!</p>;
```

`React4xp.CLIENT` exposes the method `.render(component, targetElementId, props)` to the browser:

```html
<!-- main.html: -->

<html>
<head>
    <title>Hey world</title>    
    
        <!-- You can get React and ReactDOM from CDN like this, if you want to skip the react4xp-runtime-externals step in build.gradle: --
    <script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react@16/umd/react.production.min.js"></script>
    <script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@16/umd/react-dom.production.min.js"></script>
        -->
        
</head>
<body>
    <div id="targetContainer"></div>

    <script data-th-each="url: ${urls}" data-th-src="${url}"></script>

    <script defer>
        React4xp.CLIENT.render(React4xp.SimpleGreeter, 'targetContainer', {worldOrWhatever: "World"});
    </script>

    </body>
</html>
```


#### 3. Completely standalone HTML
If you need or want to use React4xp without a controller, the services offer the same functionality clean from HTML. All you need is the URL for the client wrapper as mentioned above, and the jsxPaths for the components you want to render. 

After the browser has run the client, use `React4xp.CLIENT.renderWithDependencies(entries, callback)`, where `entries` is an object where the keys are component jsxPaths and each of the values are: `targetId` (target id to container DOM element) and `props`. The `callback` is an optional function that will be called at the end of the chain of scripts downloaded and run:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>React4xp standalone page 2</title>

    <!-- OPTION: You can get React and ReactDOM from CDN like this, if you want to skip the react4xp-runtime-externals step in build.gradle: -->
        <script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react@16/umd/react.production.min.js"></script>
        <script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@16/umd/react-dom.production.min.js"></script>

    <!-- The client wrapper is needed either way: -->
    <script src="/_/service/<app.name>/react4xp-client"></script>

</head>
<body>

    <div id="simple_target"></div>
    <div id="reduxed_target"></div>
    
    <script>

            // Actual rendering:
            React4xp.CLIENT.renderWithDependencies(
                {
                    SimpleGreeter: {
                        targetId: 'simple_target',
                        props: {worldOrWhatever: "whatever"}
                    },

                    'site/parts/clientReduxed/clientReduxed': {
                        targetId: 'reduxed_target',
                        props: {
                            react4xpId: "12345",
                            greetings: {
                                greetingsCount: 1,
                                greeteeCount: 1,
                                greetee: "different world"
                            },
                        },
                    },

                },

                // Demo callback:
                function() { console.log("This is inserted and called after rendering the components."); }
            );
    </script>
    </body>
</html>

```

### Easy and direct rendering with `React4xp.render` 

`React4xp.render(request, params)` generates an object with `body` and `pageContribution` attributes, ready for being returned as-is from an XP controller. The HTML `body` will contain a target container for the rendered component, inside an HTML body if one was was included in the `params` argument object, or generated if not. 

The `request` argument is used to determine the context of the rendering: 
  - If the rendering happens in the _edit_ mode of XP Content Studio, the react component is rendered server-side as static HTML. In this mode, any pageContributions from the `params` are just passed through unchanged.  
  - If the rendering is in _preview_ or _live_ mode: client-side rendering. The body is ensured to contain a matching-ID target container for rendering in the browser, while the pageContributions get scripts for this rendering - inline and referred by autogenerated URLs.
  
The `params` argument is an object that must include EITHER `component` or  `jsxPath`. All other parameters are optional:
  - `component` (object) XP component object (used to extrapolate a jsxPath - sufficient if JSX entry file is in the same folder and has the same name).
  - `jsxPath` (string) path to react component entry, see available paths in `build/main/resources/react4xp/entries.json` after building. Think of this as the name of the component path.
  - `jsxFileName` (string) For using a JSX entry that's in a XP component folder but with a different file name than the XP component itself. No file extension. Untested: can probably also be used as a relative path to the XP component path?
  - `props` (object) React props to send in to the react component
  - `id` (string) Sets the target container HTML element ID. If this matches an ID in a `body` in params, the react component will be rendered there. If not, a container with this ID will be added. If `id` is missing, the `component` path is used, or a unique ID is generated if there's no component.
  - `uniqueId` (boolean or string) If set, ensures that the ID is unique. If the `id` param is set, a random integer will be postfixed to it. If `uniqueId` is a string, that will be the prefix before the random postfix. If the `id` param is used in addition to a `uniqueId` string, `uniqueId` takes presedence and overrides `id`.
  - `body` (string) Existing HTML body for adding the react component into. For example rendered from thymeleaf. If it already has a matching-ID target container, `body` passes through unchanged in client-side rendering, and has the react component added to the container in server-side rendering. Use this matching-ID option and set the `id` param to control where in the body the react component should be inserted. If there's no matching container, a matching <div> will be inserted at the end of the body, inside the root element of `body`. If `body` is missing, a pure-target-container body is generated and returned.
  - `pageContributions` (object) Pre-existing pageContributions.


## Technical overview and advanced use

### Build

An important part of the the work happens at build time, mainly by [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/). It's automated and currently set up around a particular file and directory structure:   

Webpack detects JSX component entry files (see below) and **transpiles** them to es5 under `build/resources/main/react4xp` (and `react4xp/` in the deployed JAR). The same transpiled code is run by both the browser (client side rendering) or by Nashorn (server side rendering).

Webpack uses [code splitting](https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting/) and layers the transpiled output.  
  - **Entries**: minimal JS files that are one "app" each: a top-level React component. These are what will be fed into the React renderer, available to and runnable by the browser and importing other components. JSX files will be interpreted as React entries if the source files are found under the common XP structire (`src/main/resources/site`) or under a designated directory in React4xp itself (`src/main/react4xp/_components`).
  - **Chunks**: second-level bundles/libraries of shared React (or other) components, importable by the entries. You can force shared code to be bundled into a chunk without changing the webpack.config files: simply put the shared code into `.es6` or `.jsx` files in subdirectories below `src/main/react4xp` and import it from your entries. The build does the rest.
  - **Externals**: third-level and third-party libraries such as React itself, needed both at client and server side. At this level might also be a **vendors** chunk: the leftover, non-externals common deplendencies from `node_modules/`. Use the EXTERNALS object in `webpack.config.constants.json` to separate between externals and vendors chunks.
  
This is done for performance by [client-side HTTP caching](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/optimizing-content-efficiency/http-caching): the chunks/externals/vendors bundle frequently used common dependencies into one, or a few, files that can be loaded client-side ideally just once, and be cached there for fast responsive pages (no need for PWA caching). Everything except the entries get a **content-dependent hash** added to the file name, so it only changes on actual updates to the dependencies. These hashes are exported by webpack to `chunks.*.json` files, which are used by XP to resolve the dependency file names. There's also a built `entries.json` file, which both allows developers to look up available entries, and lets the library exclude the entries from the hashed-name handling.

Because the layers are differently used and have different needs for chunking and hashing strategies, there are 4 webpack steps, each triggered by separate gradle tasks and each with their own `webpack.config.*.js`. In addition to entries, chunks and externals, there's the React4xp frontend-only Core and the backend-only Nashorn polyfills. 
  
### Entries and Core

React component entries can be used by XP by referring to their entry paths (`jsxPath`, unless the XP component is used as a shortcut like in the example). This path is both part of the URL for the component file, and the reference to the component in the client-side script. The global client-side `React4xp` object has some basic `Reac4xp.Core` code that wraps the React renderer, as well as entry path attributes that expose the react components. Reac4xp.Core is built from `src/main/react4xp/clientsideRendering.es6`.

For example, in the hello-world example above, the entry path of `example.jsx` is `"site/parts/example/example"`, so it could also have been rendered with `React4xp.render(request, "site/parts/example/example"):`. Either way, the browser downloads ...`_/service/com.enonic.starter.react/react4xp/site/parts/example/example.js` and calls `React4xp.Core.render` with `React4xp['site/parts/example/example'].default`.       


### The library: `lib/enonic/react4xp/index.es6` 

Used in XP controllers. Relies on webpack having done its job (setting up the entry paths, the hashed chunk names and the correct placement of all the files), and handles the interplay between backend and frontend mainly using the entry paths. In addition to the `.render` method from the hello-world example are some other options:
  - `React4xp.renderSSR(params)`: Same as React4xp.render, but without the `request`, and always renders static server-side markup. No need for a `request` argument. Worth noting: the first server-side rendering in Nashorn is much slower than repeated calls to the same component. The component is cached as a function, so re-calling it even with different props will be much more performant. 
  - `React4xp.renderClient(params)`: Same as React4xp.renderSSR, but always renders active client-side react. Might nota always work so well in XP content studio's edit mode).
  - `React4xp.renderMarkupAndHydrate(params)`: Same as React4xp.renderSSR, but also tries to activate the component (hydrate; populate the previously rendered DOM with active react functionality). As above, your mileage might vary when it comes to how it behaves in XP content studio's edit mode.
  
For more fine-grained control, build a **React4xp instance**. This can be done in two ways:
  - `new React4xp(initParam);`, the basic constructor where `initParam` is either the XP component object, or an entry path string, or
  - `React4xp.buildFromParams(params)`, an all-in-one builder where `params` are the same as for `.renderSSR` and `.renderClient`, except for the `body` and `pageContributions` fields which aren't used here. 
  
This React4xp instance has the following methods:
  - `.setId(id)`: Sets the ID of the target container the component will be rendered into, or deletes it if omitted.
  - `.uniqueId()`: Makes sure the container ID is uinique, using a random postfix.
  - `.setJsxFileName(fileName)`: Adjusts the jsxPath by changing the file name. Useful for different-named jsx files when using the component shortcut.
  - `.setProps(props)`: Sets the component's top-level props.
  - `.renderClientPageContributions(pageContributions)`: Renders only the needed pageContributions for running the component on the client side. Includes dependency chunks, the component script, and the trigger. If a `pageContributions` argument is added, the rendered pageContributions are added to it, removing any duplicate scripts.
  - `.renderTargetContainer(body, content)`: Generates an HTML body string (or modifies it, if included as a `body` parameter) with a target container element with the ID of this component - into which the component will be rendered. If the component HTML already has been rendered (e.g. by `.renderToString`), add it as the `content` argument, and it will be inserted into the container.
  - `.renderToString(overrideProps)`: Renders a pure static HTML string of the react component, without a body / other surrounding HTML. If `overrideProps` is added, any props previously added to the instance are ignored.
  - `.renderIntoBody(body)`: Shorthand method, combining `renderToString` and `renderTargetContainer` for a full serverside HTML string rendering of the instance. 

The **examples** branch in this repo should have more on how to use this library in controllers.


### The service: `services/react4xp/react4xp.es6`

Used to fetch all transpiled JS files - entries and dependency chunks - by entry path, i.e. the path of the transpiled file below `build/resources/main/react4xp` (or `/react4xp/` in the JAR). Handles headers for efficient clientside HTTP caching, also caches everything to memory on the server for performance. 


### Nashorn server-side rendering

The serverside-oriented rendering methods in the library pass the transpiled component by name (entry path / jsxPath) to some java code that loads and runs the component in Nashorn. The Nashorn engine is pre-polyfilled using some other pre-transpiled code (see `src/main/react4xp/_nashornPolyfills_.es6`). 

Each specific component is stored in the nashorn engine by name on first access, as a function that takes props as argument. This way, the components are slow on the first rendering (around 1 second in the test cases) but much faster on repeated access, even with different props (2 - 30 ms).

Some other java code, HTMLInserter, is responsible for inserting HTML into other HTML. This is used for adding a container element to an existing body if it's missing a maching-ID target container, and to insert a rendered component into a target container in a preexisting body.

Errors on serverside are logged thoroughly for developers, and a minimal error message is returned as HTML for visible frontend output. When errors happen, the component in question is cleared from the engine's component cache.

Nashorn server-side rendering is recommended in the edit mode of XP content studio, to isolate away active scripts (which may interfere with the editing) while still keeping a visual representation of the component. The basic `.render` method selects this automatically.

#### Support, versions and polyfilling

While most react components so far seem to run fine, there may be some cases where the Nashorn engine will complain. If so, adapt your code, or add polyfilling to `src/main/react4xp/_nashornPolyfills_.es6`.

The JS support in Nashorn varies between different JVMs. Enonic XP 6 runs the java 8 JVM, while XP 7 will run java 11, which has better support - including ES6 natively. There may still be uncovered areas and unsupported functions, though.


## Other & misc.:

### Component-less entries

If a JSX file is found under `src/main/react4xp/_components` or below, it will keep that relative path and be transpiled to an entry component. Good for component entries that shouldn't belong to a particular XP part/page. This approach is untested and not focused on, but should allow pure-app use. Files will be transpiled to the `/react4xp/` root folder, and their entry names will be the file path under `_components`, i.e. without "_components" or "site" (or file extension) in the name.

### Controllable chunking

Add other subfolders under `src/main/react4xp/`: All other subfolders than _component under src/main/react4xp will be collected to chunks of their own, where the chunk name will be the same as the subfolder, plus a content hash. This includes both JSX and ES6 source files.

Note that source files that aren't imported by entries will not be transpiled to the build folder. If you add source files right on the `src/main/react4xp/` root folder, they will be bundled into the entry file instead of a chunk - increasing the entry's size!

### Stateful class components

For rendering stateful class components, they must be wrapped during the export:

```jsx harmony
import React from 'react';

class WorldGreeter expands React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
        this.state = {
            greetee: props || "world",
        }
    }
    
    render() {
        return (<p>Hello {this.state.greetee}!</p>);
    }
}

export default (props) => <WorldGreeter {...props} />;
```
